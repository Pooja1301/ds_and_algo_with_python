- This repository contains some algorithm problem solved in Python
- All program should work fine.
- For Sudoku, you have to change your recursion limit in your system. It's not a good practice but my program is recursive and tail recursion is not a strong area of Python. In future I'll try to improve my program.
-For inscreasing the recursion limit you can use the command as following: **setrecursionlimit(limitsize)**.
